What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

The transition from procedural to OOP went pretty smoothly. I've mostly programmed in Java prior to this, this was my first full Python project, so there was a lot of learning along the way. But most of it was learning how to code Python, not how to code OOP. Almost all of the methods worked properly upon initial testing (which was shocking).

A challenge was trying to make sure that the inventory handled each computer object properly. 

Advice for future students:
Plan your classes before writing the code. Take time to think about how you'll divide up the logic between classes. Write down the attributes and methods each class should have before starting to code.
Test often, it'll make your life easier. I didn't test often enough and then I would have 10 errors that were slightly harder to fix rather than being able to fix them one at a time. 
Refactor if you need to. If something isn't working, take a step back and reevaluate how you've organized your code.
